# Finding-All-Prime-Numbers-Under-1-000-000-
In this post I'm going to go through a function in Python that can quickly find all the Prime numbers below a given value. For example, if I passed this function a value of 1,000, it would return all the prime numbers below 1000.

If you're not sure what a Prime number is, it is a number that can only be divided wholly by itself and one. So a prime number can be other numbers too as long as 1 and itself divides into it. So 8 is not a prime number since 8 divides into 1, 2, 4 and 8.
